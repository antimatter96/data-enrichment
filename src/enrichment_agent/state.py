    Messages track the primary execution state of the agent.

    Typically accumulates a pattern of:

    1. HumanMessage - user input
    2. AIMessage with .tool_calls - agent picking tool(s) to use to collect
        information
    3. ToolMessage(s) - the responses (or errors) from the executed tools

        (... repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed ...)
    4. AIMessage without .tool_calls - agent responding in unstructured
        format to the user.

    5. HumanMessage - user responds with the next conversational turn.

        (... repeat steps 2-5 as needed ... )

    Merges two lists of messages, updating existing messages by ID.

    By default, this ensures the state is "append-only", unless the
    new message has the same ID as an existing message.

    Returns:
        A new list of messages with the messages from `right` merged into `left`.
        If a message in `right` has the same ID as a message in `left`, the
        message from `right` will replace the message from `left`.
